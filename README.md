## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make sure the directory follows:
```File Tree
BATT
â”œâ”€â”€ model
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ resnet
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vgg
â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cifar10

## Attack
To train the BATT-R in the paper, run these commands:

CIFAR-10:
```train
python run_batt_r.py
```

## Infected model
Get attacked model in the dictionary 'result':
```File Tree
result
â”œâ”€â”€ attack
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ batt_r_cifar10.pth
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
```
